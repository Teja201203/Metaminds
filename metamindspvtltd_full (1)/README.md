# metamindspvtltd - Frontend (Full features)

This repository contains the full frontend extracted from `frontend.txt`. It preserves the original structure, components, and markup.

## Included files
- `index.html` — main HTML (links to external stylesheet)
- `styles/style.css` — extracted CSS from the original file
- `images/logo.png` — placeholder image (replace with your real logo)
- `README.md` — this file

## How to use locally
1. Unzip and open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Replace `images/logo.png` with your real logo(s) as needed.
3. If any JavaScript is required (inline in `index.html`), it remains as in the original file.

## Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit - full frontend extracted"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/metamindspvtltd.git
git push -u origin main
```

## Deploy via GitHub Pages
1. Push to the `main` branch.
2. In GitHub repo -> Settings -> Pages: choose `main` and root `/`.
3. Save and wait a few minutes for the site to be published:
   `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/metamindspvtltd/`
